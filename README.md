# ANN-project-Deepfakes are modified media products created to 
disseminate false information, hoaxes, or other offensive 
material. Due to the proliferation of easy-to-use tools for 
editing and creating images, image faking has recently 
become a severe problem.
Deep fakes occur when it is easy to toy with an image's 
features or to transfer person X's facial expressions to person 
Y's face. We strive to find a solution to the issue of picture 
and video alteration because deep fakes are challenging to 
spot due to the change in the images being so convincing. 
Therefore, it is challenging to counteract false information 
and data because of current developments in architectural 
models that produce these fakes.
These are deficient However, Deepfakes leave behind 
observable visual artefacts that may be examined using 
different neural networks models. This paper constrains the 
problem of deepfakes images and how to solve this problem 
using different neural networks models.
